## 🎮 Title: Static Tide

**Static Tide** is a survival-adventure game where you play as a sailor caught in a storm during a mysterious toxic waste dumping mission. Hired by an eccentric billionaire, your goal was to dump hazardous materials far into the ocean, away from prying eyes. But things have gone wrong.

After a violent storm knocks you unconscious, you awaken to find the crew gone and something strange left behind. Trapped and alone, your only chance of escape lies in locating three keys — red, green, and blue — which can unlock the door to a hidden exit, possibly left by the fleeing crew.
