## 🎮 Title: Static Tide

**Static Tide** is a survival-adventure game where you play as a sailor caught in a storm during a mysterious toxic waste dumping mission. Hired by an eccentric billionaire, your goal was to dispose of hazardous materials far into the ocean, away from prying eyes.

But something doesn’t feel right.

Before the storm hit, there were whispers among the crew — rumors that this mission wasn’t just about dumping waste. Some believed the barrels contained something far more dangerous... possibly **explosive**. Tensions were high, and unease spread as the ship pushed deeper into open water.

After a violent storm knocks you unconscious, you awaken to find the crew gone — and something else left behind. Trapped and alone, your only chance of escape lies in locating three keys — red, green, and blue — which unlock the door to a hidden exit, possibly left by the fleeing crew.
